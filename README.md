Project Statement: Arduino-Based Real-Time Health Monitoring System
This project aims to develop a real-time health monitoring system using an Arduino microcontroller and biomedical sensors to track vital signs such as heart rate and body temperature. The system will collect, process, and display data on an LCD screen while optionally transmitting it wirelessly to a mobile app for remote monitoring. By integrating embedded systems and sensor technology, this project seeks to provide an affordable and accessible solution for continuous health tracking, particularly in remote or underserved areas.
